# US Names 

## EDA on US baby names dataset on Kaggle

The following is an (ongoing) exploratory analysis of baby names in the US via the Social Security Admninistration, inspired by a collection of articles and videos over the years that have discussed the emergence of pink and blue as gendered colors, and how they switched at one point in time. Names are also gendered in the US, and I'm curious to know what names have moved in terms of gender domination over time.

(Gender is encoded here as 'Male' and 'Female' though I acknowledge these words actually refer to biological distinctions and just two labels are not fully representative of the gender spectrum anyway)



Here, I've put together information on a specific name, "Frankie", in order to see what the percentage of name usage per decade, split by gender. I've also added a count column in order to understand how the name frequency, and assumingly name popularity, changed over decades.

I can now look at the visual representation of how the name "Frankie" has been assigned at birth over decades. I'm surprised to see that "Frankie" was a predominantly a female-assigned name originally. The flip between genders seems to have happened in the 1940s, and the percentage of Male/Female babies assigned this name appears to now be heading toward an equal split.
